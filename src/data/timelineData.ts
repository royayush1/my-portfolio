The webforms will be used by both CSL students and community partners, while the automated emails will be sent to students, community partners, and CSL coordinators. Copies of all forms save to cloud storage, allowing coordinators to review past submissions; additionally, a spreadsheet will be generated that will allow coordinators to view the status of all ongoing submissions.",
